Dinner Decider enables 2–4 people to join a shared session (via short code or link), view the same curated list of dinner options, privately select the items they’d be happy with, and then reveals only the overlapping choices for the group to choose from. The experience optimizes for speed and fairness: no accounts required initially, mobile-first UI, and minimal steps to decision. If there’s no overlap, the group can choose to rerun with same inputs, but no automated fallback is provided.
