# CI/CD Pipeline Summary

## ✅ Setup Complete!

Your project now has a **simple, reliable CI/CD pipeline** with two parts:

### 1. GitHub Actions (PR Quality Gate)
- **Triggers**: Automatically runs on every pull request to `main`
- **Purpose**: Ensures code quality before merge
- **What it does**:
  - ✅ Lints backend & frontend code
  - ✅ Type checks TypeScript
  - ✅ Runs backend tests (with Redis)
  - ✅ Runs frontend unit tests

### 2. Railway Auto-Deploy (Continuous Deployment)
- **Triggers**: Automatically deploys when code is pushed to `main` branch
- **Purpose**: Keeps production in sync with main branch
- **What it does**:
  - ✅ Deploys backend service
  - ✅ Deploys frontend service
  - ✅ No manual intervention needed

## How to Use

### Creating a Feature
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# 2. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add: My awesome feature"

# 3. Push to GitHub
git push origin feature/my-feature

# 4. Create PR on GitHub
# → GitHub Actions runs tests automatically

# 5. After tests pass, merge PR
# → Railway automatically deploys to production
```

### The Complete Flow
```
Code Change → PR Created → GitHub Actions Tests →
Review → Merge to Main → Railway Auto-Deploy → Live in Production
```

## Monitoring

### GitHub Actions
- View test results: Go to PR → "Checks" tab
- View all runs: Repository → "Actions" tab
- Command line: `gh run list`

### Railway Deployments
- View in Railway dashboard: https://railway.app
- Monitor logs: Railway dashboard → Select service → "Deployments"
- Check status: `railway status`

## Key Benefits

✅ **Simple**: Only 2 moving parts (GitHub Actions + Railway)
✅ **Reliable**: Railway's native deployment is battle-tested
✅ **Fast**: No complex deployment scripts to maintain
✅ **Safe**: Tests must pass before merge
✅ **Automatic**: Zero manual deployment steps

## Configuration Files

- `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - GitHub Actions PR tests
- `CICD_SETUP.md` - Detailed setup documentation
- `DEPLOY_GUIDE.md` - Railway deployment configuration

## Important: Railway Service Configuration

For a monorepo, you **must** configure each Railway service separately:

###Backend Service:
1. Go to Railway → Select project → Backend service
2. Settings → Source → Connect GitHub
3. Select branch: `main`
4. **Important**: Set Root Directory to `backend`
5. Save settings

### Frontend Service:
1. Go to Railway → Select project → Frontend service
2. Settings → Source → Connect GitHub
3. Select branch: `main`
4. **Important**: Set Root Directory to `frontend`
5. Make sure `RAILPACK_SPA_OUTPUT_DIR=frontend/dist` is set in env vars
6. Save settings

## Testing the Pipeline

1. **Create a test PR**:
   - Make a small change
   - Push and create PR
   - Watch GitHub Actions run tests

2. **Merge and deploy**:
   - Merge PR to main
   - Railway auto-deploys both services
   - Monitor in Railway dashboard
